# Checkers-Web-App
A web application that utilizes Blazor to allow the visitor to play a game of checkers

There is still one bug that I need to fix, but it is a mostly functional game at the moment. Currently, when the player whose turn it is has more than one available checker to jump, the one that is the top/bottom left will always be removed no matter which jump the user performs.
